[No Kill Pima County][no-kill-pima-website] is an animal advocacy group that works with the Pima County Animal Care Center (PACC) to reduce the number of animals that are unnecessarily euthanized in Tucson. On occasion, I do data analysis work for them and recently I created an interactive visualization tool they can use to investigate patterns in euthanasia trends:

The application was build on AWS Elastic Beanstalk using Python, DC.js, D3.js, and keen.io. [You can see it here.][dashboard-website]
