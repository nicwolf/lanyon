*I dug this one out of my Google Drive yesterday. The text that originally accompanied this project has been lost. I've dated the article to reflect, approximately, when the project was originally finished. The writeup that follows will be brief and I will do my best to faithfully recall the circumstances surrounding this project.*

During my second year of University I participated in a project with fellow students and the Arizona Sonora Desert Museum (ASM). We conducted field research in an attempt to characterize the activity of animals living in riparian areas (land-water-interfaces) in the Sonoran Desert. The "Wildcat Water Watchers".

We identified twenty-five animals that act as indicator species; the presence of a Gila Monster, for example, is a sign of a healthy riparian area.

Jill Wallitschek and I worked together on creating an guide for identifying these animals, meant for children to use as part of a citizen-science partnership between their schools and the ASDM.
